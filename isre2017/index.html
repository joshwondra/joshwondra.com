		<h1>Welcome</h1>
		<p>Over the years, the ISRE conferences have become a reference occasion for all the disciplines involved in the study of emotion from all over the world to meet and share the results of their work. Do you want to know what the state-of-the-art is in emotion research? ISRE 2017 is the place to be!</p>

		<p>Our goal in preparing ISRE 2017 is to offer you the most vibrant environment to present your work, to follow the current developments in the study of emotion in your own discipline(s), and to discover the latest advances in other fields.</p>

		<p>As an affective scientist - whether from the humanities, the social sciences, the behavioral and brain sciences, or any other domain - ISRE 2017 awaits you. We are looking forward to meeting you in St. Louis next July!</p>

		<p>Hillary Elfenbein (Olin School of Business, Washington University)
	on behalf of the ISRE 2017 scientific and organizing teams</p>

		<p>We are very grateful to all our sponsors below for supporting ISRE 2017</p>
