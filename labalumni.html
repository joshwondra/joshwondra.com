				<h3>What are you currently doing in your career?</h3>
					<p>I work as a lab manager for Arnold Ho and Josh Ackerman (both social psychology professors) in the Department of Psychology at the University of Michigan.</p>
				<h3>When did you graduate and what has your career path been since then?</h3>
					<p>I graduated in 2013. The first year after graduation, I waitressed and volunteered in two psych labs. The second year, I was a part-time paid research assistant in Shinobu Kitayama's lab and also volunteered in another psych lab. The third year, I started my current position.</p>
				<h3>What advice do you have for current students to prepare them for their post-college careers?</h3>
					<p>I don't know what is best for students who are not interested in PhDs in psychology, but for those who are aiming for one, I'd suggest joining labs that are either 1) very related to your research interests or 2) very conducive to learning. It's good to know the "typical" successful candidate that gets accepted into the programs you're aiming for because knowing what kind of information or abilities you should learn and communicating this with your supervisor(s) is more effective than passively accepting whatever responsibilities happen to come your way. If you want to get a lab manager position, you should 1) let your supervisors know in case they hear of any and 2) apply to any and all positions you find, which will most likely pop up around January-March every year. Something like 100-150 applicants apply to most positions so you'd have to apply to many positions to get one.</p>
				<h3>Are you willing to let current members of the lab contact you to discuss their career development?</h3>
					<p>Yes, please get in touch with me by e-mail</p>

				<h3>What are you currently doing in your career?</h3>
					<p>I work for Nielsen. Nielsen is a consumer & media insights company best known for their TV ratings. I work in their Data Science department doing a rotational program, so every 6 months for 2 years I switch onto a new team and work on a new project. At a high level, I do a mix of work: data analysis and methodology (using Excel, R, Python), research development and methodology, and presentations.</p>

				<h3>When did you graduate and what has your career path been since then?</h3>
					<p>I graduated in May of 2015 with a B.A. in Biopsychology, Cognition, and Neuroscience. I am still in my first job out of college, which is described above.</p>

				<h3>What advice do you have for current students to prepare them for their post-college careers?</h3>
					<p>Time management is incredibly important, learn to be ok with ambiguity, and be accountable. You will likely not have someone telling you when do to what, and often you will have to set your own deadlines. Also, it will be up to you to create a work-life balance. When it comes to ambiguity, in my experience how exactly to do your work will not be clearly defined. You will have to determine what you feel is the best way to do the work you are being asked to do. Lastly, if you say you are going to be responsible for something, make sure you end up pulling through and keep your word. It will make people want to work with you more, and people will give you more responsbility and ownership.</p>

				<h3>Are you willing to let current members of the lab contact you to discuss their career development?</h3>
					<p>Yes, please get in touch with me by e-mail or phone.</p>

				<h3>What are you currently doing in your career?</h3>
					<p>I am working as a law clerk for a bankruptcy firm in Royal Oak, MI. I’m gaining experience and honing skills that will help me in law school this Fall and beyond.</p>

				<h3>When did you graduate and what has your career path been since then?</h3>
					<p>I graduated with a BA in psychology in 2014. I took a year off to figure out what I wanted to do, and in this time I realized that law school was a good fit. With a solid research background, I felt that a lot of the skills I gained during that experience would translate well with a career in law. I prepped for the LSAT and applied to schools in 2015. I got a job as a law clerk after an internship went well and I’m waiting for school to start in August.</p>

				<h3>What advice do you have for current students to prepare them for their post-college careers?</h3>
					<p>In retrospect, I think it’s very important to hone skills during college. Take on opportunities that allow you to develop skills that will be beneficial in your desired career. As an intern at a law firm, I got to answer phones and deal with clients on a regular basis. This isn’t something you can necessarily experience in the classroom. I wish I would have thought about it this way before I graduated and not after.</p>

				<h3>Are you willing to let current members of the lab contact you to discuss their career development?</h3>
					<p>Yes, please contact me by e-mail, but I am willing to speak on the phone later.</p>

				<h3>What are you currently doing in your career?</h3>
					<p>Currently I am on “summer break”, I just finished taking my MCAT and I am starting med school applications. By the end of August I will be working in Americorp for my gap year.</p>

				<h3>When did you graduate and what has your career path been since then?</h3>
					<p>I graduated in December 2015, and stayed at Michigan the following semester working as a Caregiver.  In April I finished that and applied to Americorp, and got a placement in Florida. My current plan is to go to Medical school once my year of service at Americorp is over. </p>

				<h3>What advice do you have for current students to prepare them for their post-college careers?</h3>
					<p>I guess two things I can say which both relate to each other is start planning early, and do your research. Don’t go crazy and plan out your life while you’re still in freshman year, but don’t be like a lot of seniors I see who still have no idea what they’re going to do half way into their last semester in college. I’d say you should have a general idea by your junior year what you’re looking to do with your degree, and once senior year starts you should do some research into where you think the future will take you. Oh, and be flexible to change, I didn’t start off wanting to do Americorp, but after looking into a lot of different options I found that it was most suited towards what I wanted from my gap year.</p>
