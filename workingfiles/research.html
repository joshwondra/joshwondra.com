	<h2>This is typically studied as empathy&mdash;feeling the <em>same</em> emotion as someone else.</h2> 
	<p>The way that we typically think of empathy is that you see someone else who feels sad, and so you feel sad, and it's as though their sadness has passed to you (sometimes people use the metaphor &ldquo;emotion contagion&rdquo;).</p>
	<h2>But we often feel emotions for people who don't seem to feel anything at all.</h2> 	<p>You can feel embarrassed for a friend who doesn't know that he has food stuck to his teeth as he introduces himself to a new group of people. There's no embarrassment to "contagiously" pass from your friend to you.</p>
	<p>In cases like this, your vicarious emotion has more to do with the way that you think about your friend's situation than with how your friend feels. The same is true when the other person is emotional. If you see someone crying because her mother suddenly passed away, then you'll probably feel sad for her. But if you see someone crying because she didn't get a Lamborghini for her birthday, then you'll probably tell her to get over it.</p>
	<h2>My research team is investigating how our perceptions of others' situations affect how much we empathize.</h2>
